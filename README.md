# Sudoku-using-Deep-Learning
Human approach of solving sudoku is by filling one number at a time and we get better idea for solving it further. We used this concept in our deep learning project for solving sudoku puzzles. We get around 99.6% accuracy on our test sets (2 lakh sudoku puzzles).

Contains Kaggle link for the dataset and onedrive link for our saved model of CNN.

# App.py: Flask code for deployment
# Model.py: This contains code for our Machine Learning model to predict our sudoku and also testing on it.
# Request.py: This uses requests module to call APIs already defined in app.py and dispalys the returned value.
# Sudoku_frame_html: HTML code for our interface design to take user inputs and do the prediction.
# Readme.text: It contains the link (for the dataset and the learning model of CNN).
